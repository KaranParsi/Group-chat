- Write your code on notepad and save the file as (classname.java)(my class name is Groupchat), compile and run it on JVM, save the path in the environment variable and set up the environment in your control panel when you download the jdk.
- Then open the command prompt and go to the path where your file is placed.
- Check if you have any errors using javac Groupchat.java, If you get no errors then run the command for execution java Groupchat 239.0.0.0 1234. you can open as many as command prompts you want but once you compile the code in one command prompt, you don't need to compile it in others.. Therefore in the other prompts just go the file path and run the execution command java Groupchat 239.0.0.0 1234.
- To exit the chat you can type Exit and press enter.
